# About me
I have always been interested in how things work and felt comfortable with new technologies. Combining work and oportunity to travel has always seemed to me perfect way to live. That's why I realised that programming can be both my hobby and my job. 
Since I worked in Dubai as hostel administrator I know how to communicate with different people from all over the world. 
As my start in programming was successfully completing the course "C# Developer" in Education Center of High-Tech Park.

# Interests
_Airsoft._ This kind of activity let me get rid of negative emotions and get possitive ones and also gives me a good workout. Moreover, it is a good way to meet new people and get some interesting experience.

_Board games._ Gathering with friends and playing board games in the evenings is one of my favotite amusements. It is a good way to chat with friends, it trains your logic, communicative and strategy skills in a sence and games give you a lot of different emotions, so you always have fun.
